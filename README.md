XSLT-Generic-Fields
===================

Fun with generic fields with xslt


This project was part of a freelance project with Applied Cognetics / National WebLinks back in Jan 2012.

My client was creating a business-lead generator and needed a way to parse and output data in a meaningful way.

Each of file peforms a spsecific transform, which type of transform it does is listed in the file name.
